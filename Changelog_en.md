# Changelog

## 3.0.0

Support IPIP.ent IPDB database. DATX database is no longer supported.

## 2.0.0

Actually there literally nothing changed since 1.0.0

## 1.0.0

Today I luckily found how to generate the url for querying IP-Geolocation on ipip.net. So this is the update for it.

Now you can click the address-info and open a new page of ipip.net to get more information about the IP-Geolocation information.

IPIP.net doesn't offer English version of database. I decide that the 0.1.x version will no longer be supported.

Users using 0.2.x please update to this version.

## 0.2.x

Support IPIP.net DATX database. DAT database is no longer supported.

## 0.1.3

- Update IPIP database from 201707 to 201803.

I don't know why the database file is smaller than the older one.

IPIP.net will not support .dat database any longer, so a new version of WP-IPIP is on working for the .datx database.

## 0.1-0.1.2

- First commit
- Update to new IPIP lib and database (201707).

Notice the database file is much larger than before, so it will cost more memory.
